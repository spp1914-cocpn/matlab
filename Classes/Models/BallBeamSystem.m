classdef BallBeamSystem < NonlinearPlant
    % Implementation of a ball rolling freely on a rotating beam with  
    % nonlinear dynamics according to x_dot = f(x,u,w)
    % x=[q;q_dot;i] is the 5-dimensional state vector consisting of
    % the generalized coordinates q =[r; theta], consisting of the displacement of the ball (r, in meters) along the beam 
    % and the angular rotation of the beam (theta, in radians), and the
    % current flowing through the servo-motor (i, in amperes) that generates the torque required to rotate the beam up and down. 
    % u is the control input (voltage, in volts) applied to the servo-motor to produce the torque,
    % and w is an optional process noise, modeling disturbance forces (in
    % newtons and volts, respectively) acting on the ball's movement (i.e,
    % in direction of r) and the control input.
    % Note that the r and theta wer chosen such that r=0 represents the center of the beam, 
    % r>0 indicates a displacement to the right, and theta > 0 means a counter-clockwise beam rotation. 
    % Consequently, the unstable equilibrium is given by x=[0;0;0;0;0].

            %      If none is provided, the value given by this

            %
            %   >> contDisturbanceForceAct (Nonnegative scalar, optional)
            %      The variance of the continuous-time disturbance, in volts squared,
            %      additionally entering at the actuator to drive the servo-motor.
            %      If none is provided, the value given by this
            %      instance's <varDisturbanceForceActuatorContLin> property is used.
